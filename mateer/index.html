          <p>Barclays Rating: <strong>Market Weight</strong>  <br />
            Moody’s/S&amp;P/Fitch Ratings: <strong> Baa3/BBB-/BBB-</strong> </p>

            <h4>Investment Summary</h4>

            <p>PAA has essentially lost $200mn of EBITDA, which means that the partnership needs to find a way to reduce debt by ~$1bn relative to what it would have been before the guidance reduction.  At this point, it is unclear to us whether the agencies are willing to consider any of the Supply &amp; Logistics (S&L) EBITDA as ratable, but to frame some ranges (using $100mn of S&L EBITDA in 2018), we think that the distribution needs to be reset to somewhere in a $1.40-1.60/unit range, the partnership needs to sell at least another $150mn of assets (beyond what was just announced), and PAA needs to find a way to pay down another $400-600mn of debt (potentially through an equity raise).  Clearly, each of these levers interacts with the others such that if one moves higher or lower, the other levers can change to compensate.</p>

     <p>After marking our fair value target for PAA 2026s to market to reflect the recent uptick in volatility (PAA’s ratings travails are occurring during a risk-off moment in the credit markets), we continue to think that they are fairly valued, assuming a Ba1/BBB-/BBB- ratings outcome.  We see up to 20bp of additional widening in PAA 3.85% 2023s (which would take them flat to the crossover index, but still 20bp tight of DCP Midstream 2023s) and see risk that the 10s30s curve could steepen.  It is not clear to us whether S&amp;P will place PAA’s BBB- rating on negative watch (or merely a negative outlook), but given that we think both of the other agencies came in a bit more negative than we expected, we think the risk of a negative watch has increased.  We expect a press release from S&amp;P to be the next catalyst for bonds.</p>

    <h4>Relative Value</h4>

    <p>In our view, although we expected a review for downgrade from Moody’s and a downgrade to BBB- from Fitch, the Moody’s language (ie, a very high likelihood of a near-term downgrade) and the Fitch outlook (negative) were both a bit worse than we were expecting.  As a result, we think that there is higher risk of S&P also surprising us to the downside versus our base case expectation of a negative outlook; the agency could place PAA’s rating on negative watch.</p>

        <span>The market for CDS options has experienced significant growth</span>
      </aside> -->

      <p>We do not consider the asset sale announcement to be spread-moving, given that PAA management indicated on its 2Q17 earnings conference call that it had just signed a $250mn asset sale agreement and management previously guided for investors to assume around a 10x average blended multiple on divestitures.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, PAA does not have many good options, in our opinion, but it does have options.  In addition, although cutting the distribution helps coverage and does improve leverage over a period of time, it does not benefit credit metrics right away in the same manner as do asset sales and/or equity raises.</p>

      <!-- <aside class="pull">CDS index options provide the right to buy or sell index protection at a predetermined strike and time</aside> -->

      <p>At this point, it is not clear to us whether the agencies consider any S&L EBITDA to be ratable, but if we assume that the ratings will get the benefit of at least a $100mn plug for annual S&L EBITDA, the partnership’s guidance reduction essentially means that ~$200mn of EBITDA has gone away.  And in round numbers, that implies that, all else equal, debt needs to be approximately $1bn (5x leverage times $200mn lost EBITDA) lower than it otherwise would have been to keep the ratings in the same place.  Figures 1-3 attempt to show the difficulty in doing this by 2018 using only asset sales and distribution reductions.</p>

      <p>First, in Figures 1 and 2, we update our 2017/18 data tables to reflect S&L assumptions of $100mn and zero, respectively.  In Figure 1, with a $1.80/unit distribution and $250mn of incremental asset sales, we estimate that Moody’s adjusted leverage would be 5.5x and 4.9x in 2017 and 2018, respectively.  Even with a much more significant distribution cut all the way down to $1.00/unit, holding asset sales flat, we estimate that 2018 leverage would only improve to ~4.7x, although this would result in significantly stronger distribution coverage (we estimate ~2x excluding the S&amp;L business).</p>

      <p>If the agencies give no credit for S&L EBITDA, as demonstrated in Figure 2, it would take a distribution of $1.00/unit, with incremental asset sales of $250mn (as announced so far), just to get leverage to below 5x in 2018.</p>

      <p>Finally, in Figure 3, we calculate how much additional debt reduction would be required in each scenario (using $100mn of S&L EBITDA in 2018) to achieve a Moody’s adjusted debt balance that is $1bn lower than what we think the base case estimate was before the most recent guidance reduction.  In other words, whereas we previously estimated that Moody’s 2018 adjusted debt would have been ~$13.0bn before PAA’s earnings release, Figure 3 back solves for how much debt reduction is needed to achieve 2018 adjusted debt of approximately $12.0bn, reflecting the loss of roughly $200mn of annual EBITDA.  In our view, this debt reduction could take a couple of forms – it could be equity issuance or a lower short-term debt balance (perhaps from unwinding the S&amp;L business even further). </p>

      <p>Ultimately, our understanding is that Moody’s is looking for more than just metrics – the agency wants comfort that PAA can deliver operating (and financial) reliability.  But even if the Moody’s rating is largely beyond saving, and to shore up investment grade status at the other two agencies, we think that PAA will need to pursue more asset sales, a distribution cut above the illustrative 18% reduction that management provided in its 2Q17 earnings call, and some additional debt reduction that might require equity issuance.  To frame some ranges, we think that the distribution needs to be reset to $1.40-1.60/unit, the partnership needs to sell at least another $150mn of assets (beyond what was just announced), and PAA needs to find a way to pay down another $400-600mn of debt (potentially through an equity raise).</p>

      <p>PAA’s recent ratings challenges have occurred against a weaker market backdrop.  Since the close on August 7, 2017, industrials are 6bp wider and crossovers are 20bp wider.  DCP Midstream (DCP) 2023s are 5-10bp wider and Targa (NGLS) 2027s are roughly 15bp wider.  As a result, if we mark our previous +215-220bp fair value spread target for PAA 2026s to market, we think that adjusted fair value is around +230bp, which is roughly in line with a recent quote of G+237/232bp.  We think that PAA should trade tight of Hess (HES) 2027s at G+248/243bp, but the 10bp differential between the two credits in the intermediate part of the curve compares with a 35bp differential (PAA tight of HES) in the long end.  Even with the PAA bonds trading 7-8pts lower, we see downside risk to the long bonds, particularly if S&P places the ratings on negative watch.</p>

      <p>In the front end, PAA’s curve has started to flatten, with just 20bp between the 2023s and 2026s versus roughly 40bp before the ratings revisions and guidance cut.  DCP 2023s ($97.75) were recently quoted at G+247bp versus G+207bp for PAA 3.85% 2023s.  Given DCP’s business model, leverage and Ba2/BB/BB+ ratings, we think that PAA deserves to trade tight of DCP, but we see up to 20bp of relative widening for PAA, which would position the PAA 2023s at an OAS of +228bp, or directly in line with the crossover index (including Fitch) and still 20bp tight of DCP 2023s.</p>

      <h4>Highlights</h4>

      <p>On August 10, 2017, Fitch downgraded PAA to BBB- and left a negative outlook in place.  The agency cited PAA’s weaker guidance and deteriorating Supply & Logistics (S&L) segment, which makes achieving adjusted debt/EBITDA of 4.5x or below unlikely through at least 2019.  For Fitch to revise to a stable outlook, the agency stated that the partnership would need to execute on its remaining asset sales and planned distribution cut, in addition to demonstrating that it can generate 2018 EBITDA that is in line with at least the low end of management’s guidance ($2.45-2.65bn).</p>

      <p>Separately, on August 10, 2017, Holly Energy Partners (HEP) announced that it acquired from PAA a 50% interest in Frontier Aspen and a 75% interest in SLC Pipeline for aggregate cash consideration of $250mn.  HEP stated that annual forecast EBITDA from the acquired assets is $23mn. </p>
