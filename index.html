    <p>After slowing in mid-July, the big 2016 rally in credit has resumed in the past two weeks. The US Corporate index touched 147bp on August 2, following a brief sell-off, but has rallied to 138bp since then. The US High Yield index experienced a similar pause, but the price has now risen to $98.8, the highest level since June 2015. The recent context of supportive technicals and adequate economic and corporate fundamentals continues to be the dominant driver of spread performance.</p>

  <p>The market for CDS options has experienced significant growth in recent years, evolving from what used to be mostlya one-way market into a much more balanced market with the emergence of natural option buyers and sellers. Common Trades. We review a large range of CDS option trades, covering hedging of existing index positions, implementing more efficient directional trades than is possible with an index trade, and we discuss how CDS options can be used to implement very specific relative value views between, for example, high grade and high yield.

We think there could be 30-50bp of absolute return upside, as well as excess spread performance, due to the current discount to the relevant benchmarks.</p>
