The US Corporate index touched 147bp on August 2, following a brief sell-off, but has rallied to 138bp since then. The US High Yield index experienced a similar pause, but the price has now risen to $98.8, the highest level since June 2015. The recent context of supportive technicals and adequate economic and corporate fundamentals continues to be the dominant driver of spread performance.</p>
