 </p>
 <p class="E-BodyText"><strong>Barclays Rating:</strong> Underweight<o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="E-BodyText"><strong>Moody’s/S&amp;P Ratings:</strong> A3/A-<o:p></o:p>

 <p class="E-Heading1">Investment Summary<o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 </div>
 <p class="E-BodyText">We remain Underweight TRPCN in light of the company’s relatively high leverage and ongoing issuance needs, with spreads that are well tight of the sector (we attribute this mainly to single-A credit ratings).&nbsp;Although we expect pending asset sale proceeds to reduce debt somewhat in coming months, we think that leverage will remain well above the sector average for the balance of 2017 and into 2018, albeit we acknowledge TransCanada’s scale and relative cash flow stability. We recommend swapping from TRPCN 2026s and into Columbia Pipeline (CPGX) 2025s and/or EPD 2027s<o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 <div style="border-width: medium medium 1pt; border-style: none none solid; border-color: currentColor currentColor rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 0in 0in 3pt; border-image: none;">
 <p class="E-Heading1">Relative Value<o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 </div>
 <p class="E-BodyText"><img width="670" height="218" id="Picture_x0020_13" alt="download image" src="./dv.search"><o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="E-BodyText">TRPCN’s results were in line with expectations.&nbsp;We acknowledge that M&amp;A and pending asset sale proceeds continue to cause some noise in the company’s credit metrics, but note that leverage on an annualized basis weakened somewhat, as TransCanada used debt to fund the purchase of CPPL and ongoing capital spending. Pro forma for the sale of its North Eastern power assets, we estimate that leverage would have ticked higher by a smaller increment.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="E-BodyText">Although we expect the proceeds from asset sales to be put toward debt reduction related to prior acquisitions, leverage remains well above the sector average, and the company continues to rely heavily on external financing for its capital projects.&nbsp;This stands in stark contrast to the trajectory of other, predominantly US-based, operators that have simplified their structures, reduced distributions, and increased their reliance on self-funding growth.&nbsp;While we do not discount the quality of TRPCN’s assets or its solid competitive position, we do view spreads as too tight relative to the company’s current credit profile and leave our rating at Underweight.&nbsp;As an added consideration for spreads, we note that TRPCN has a near-term backlog of C$23bn, of which only C$7.5bn has been funded thus far, which to us indicates additional supply of new debt over the next few years, which could also weigh on spreads.<o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="E-BodyText">We consider fair value for TRPCN to be tight of the midstream sector, but believe that this is largely a function of its single-A credit ratings; taking into account only the company’s credit metrics relative to the group would suggest much wider trading levels, in our view.&nbsp;For investors that wish to retain exposure to TRPCN, we recommend swapping from TRPCN 2026s into Columbia Pipeline Group (CPGX) 2025s, which moves into the company’s wholly owned subsidiary while taking out several points and picking 50bp.&nbsp;Although not explicitly guaranteed, we think the recent purchase of CPPL further reinforces management’s commitment to the entity and its likelihood of supporting it in times of stress.&nbsp;We also recommend swapping from TRPCN 2026s into Enterprise Product Partners (EPD) 2027s, which moves into a credit that we think has a nearer-term path to improved leverage and is less reliant on larger-scale projects.<o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="E-BodyText">With respect to the company’s recently issued hybrid notes, we note that the TRPCN 2077s are trading roughly 190bp wide of senior spreads, priced to the next call date in 2027, which is just within our fair value range of +175-225bp for recently issued hybrid notes that are not trading with extension risk.<o:p></o:p>

 <p class="E-Heading1">Earnings Highlights<o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 </div>
 <p class="E-BodyText">On May 5, 2017, TRPCN reported adjusted EPS of C$0.81 (slight beat versus consensus) and EBITDA of C$1,870mn (in line).<o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="E-BodyText">Natural Gas Pipelines segment EBITDA was C$1,253mn, versus C$1,250mn in 4Q16 and C$880mn in 1Q16.&nbsp;The Canadian Mainline saw EBITDA improve y/y due to higher incentive earnings, offset somewhat by a lower investment base.&nbsp;The company completed its open season on the tolling option for long-term fixed-price agreements from Empress to Dawn and result in contracts for 1.5 PJ/day of natural gas at a toll of C$0.77/GJ.&nbsp;The 10-year contracts have early termination rights after five years and are subject to two years of an increased toll.&nbsp;The contribution of Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf added C$185mn to results compared with the prior-year period, while Mexican pipelines contributed C$67mn of incremental EBITDA versus 1Q16, of which C$41mn relates to the collection and recognition of revenues driven by the previously announced force majeure, while the start-up of Mazatlan resulted in C$16mn in EBITDA.<o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="E-BodyText">Keystone EBITDA rose to C$306mn, from C$302mn in 1Q16, with the oil pipeline system seeing higher volumes and marketing results.<o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="E-BodyText">With respect to the Energy East project, the NEB has elected a new panel to undertake the review of the proposed pipeline and has simultaneously voided all previous decisions made by the legacy panel.&nbsp;The new panel will next determine if TRPCN’s application is complete and, if approved, will then commence the 21-month review period.&nbsp;The pipeline has an estimated capital cost of C$15.7bn.&nbsp;The Eastern Mainline project is still estimated to cost C$2bn with an expected in-service date of 2019 and remains contingent upon the approval of the Energy East project.<o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="E-BodyText">Energy EBITDA increased sequentially, to C$305mn from C$301mn, but was down from C$320mn in the prior-year period.&nbsp;Compared with 1Q16, Eastern and Bruce Power declines offset an improvement in Western Power, with the latter driven by the termination of Alberta PPAs while Bruce saw lower gains from contracting activities, partially offset by higher volumes.&nbsp;In the US, EBITDA was lower y/y due to lower realized price in New York.&nbsp;TRPCN continues to expect the sale of its US power business to close in the first half of 2017.<o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="E-BodyText">During the quarter, total consolidated debt increased by C$1.3bn, to C$46.2bn.&nbsp;In March 2017, the company issued $1.5bn of junior subordinated notes that were used largely to fund free cash flow of negative C$911mn and the company’s recent purchase of the remaining public equity of Columbia Pipeline Partners (CPPL).&nbsp; Adjusted debt/EBITDA, which applies 25% equity credit to TRPCN’s junior subordinated debt, was 6.4x, down from 6.8x in 4Q16, but up from 6.1x in 1Q16.&nbsp; Annualizing 1Q17 EBITDA results in adjusted leverage of 6.0x.&nbsp;On a pro forma basis for the sale of the US power business and reducing debt by expected proceeds, we estimate debt/LQA EBITDA of 5.8x. <o:p></o:p>
 </p>
 <p class="E-BodyText">TRPCN’s medium to longer-term project backlog stood at C$48.0bn as of March 31, 2017. <o:p></o:p>
